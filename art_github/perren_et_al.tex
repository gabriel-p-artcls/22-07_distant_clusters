\section{Introduction}

 The unprecedented amount of high precision data for parallaxes, proper motions,
 and photometry provided by the Gaia mission in successive
 deliveries~\citep[DR2 and EDR3,][]{Gaia_2016,Gaia_EDR3} offers us a unique
 opportunity to estimate the fundamental parameters, age, distance, the observed
 mass and the metal content of open clusters (OC).
 Indeed, the arrival of new techniques for
 analyzing massive data combined with the increasing data precision promise
 more reliable results than those obtained with the old techniques mostly
 based on the visual inspection of their color-magnitude diagrams and
 isochrone fittings \citep{Phelps1994} or on direct comparison with HR diagrams
 of synthetic clusters \citep{Siess1997}. Automated processes such as the one
 applied by \cite{Kharchenko_2012} have also played an important role in
 determining cluster parameters in a massive way. But the continuous increase
 of high quality data is a defying circumstance where a variety of analysis are
 being considered even including artificial neural networks
 \citep{Cantat_2020} combined with new strategies for determining cluster
 memberships \citep{Krone2014,Cantat2018}.
 %
 The intrinsic value of studying OCs has been profusely described in several
 opportunities and we are not going to repeat them here. However a brief
 enumeration of the importance of these object is appropriate: the oldest OCs
 allow us to investigate the extension in height and radial extension of the
 galactic disk; old OCs tell us about the chemical history, the mixing processes
 and the processes of OCs destruction by interaction with other populations of
 the galaxy as well as the age-metallicity relationship 
 \citep{Friel1995,Tosi2004,Hayes2015}. The youngest OCs, on the other hand, are
 not only used as laboratories to investigate stellar evolution (they allow
 studying in detail the boundary conditions necessary to create new generations
 of stars \citep{Lada2003} but are also routinely employed too in the analysis
 of the Milky Way's
 structure~\citep{Loktin_1992,Moitinho_2006,Vazquez2008,Moitinho_2010}
 becoming particularly useful in the tracing of spiral
 arms~\citep{carraro_2013,Molina_2018}.
 %
 It is unfortunate that young OCs are mainly arranged along the galactic disk
 where the strong visual absorption and the contamination by field stars very
 often prevent observing stars in the lower part of the sequence of these
 objects. In this sense, the situation is not much better at all for the older
 OCs. In fact, these objects do not have very luminous stars in the main
 sequence, although they do in the giant branch. Notwithstanding, stars in the
 lower part of their sequences as well as those ones belonging to the giant
 branch share similar photometric characteristics with field stars making
 difficult to unravel to which population each star belongs~\citep{Hayes2015}.
 %
 The situation worsens as the distance to the older OCs increases because the
 limiting magnitude increases, which results in only a small portion of
 the lower part being usually divisible. But it is not only the photometric
 space that is disturbed by distance. The proper motions of far OCs are
 extremely difficult to separate clearly from those characterizing the field
 population against which we see them projected, therefore introducing an
 additional degree of confusion in determining memberships.

 Our interest in this current article is twofold. On the one hand, it is focused
 on reexamining the distances and properties of the most distant OCs cataloged
 so far in our Galaxy. A total of 25 such distant clusters were found
 inspecting four different recognized databases that satisfy this requirement as
 we will explain below. However, these bases show enormous differences in the
 parameters determined for them, both in distances and in ages. In part, the
 differences in the parameters for the same object may be
 due to the different techniques used to obtain them combined with the problem
 of the very large distance at which they are located.
 %
 It is of great interest that the ages for most of these OCs included in recent
 catalogs, estimated with advanced analysis techniques, are presumed to be
 larger than one billion years. But in other catalogs these same clusters have
 relatively small ages and shorter distances as well. We want to
 contribute with our analysis to resolve the origin of these differences.
 %
 On the other hand, we want to test our new membership estimation technique
 pyUPMASK~\citep{Pera_2021} in combination with
 \texttt{ASteCA}~\citep{Perren_2015}, on clusters with proper motions that are
 not easily distinguishable from that of surrounding stars, made up by a small
 number of members, and with non-trivial sequences in the photometric space.\\


 This article is structured as follows. In Sect~\ref{sec:cat_clust_data} we
 introduce the stellar cluster catalogues, the clusters selected to be
 analyzed (crossed-matched from those catalogues), and the photometric and
 astrometric data used to perform the analysis. Sect~\ref
 {sec:clust_analy} presents the methods employed in the study of all the
 clusters. The comparison of the estimated parameters with the catalogued
 values for each cluster is done in Sect~\ref{sec:results}. Finally,
 conclusions are highlighted in Sect~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Catalogues, clusters, and data}
 \label{sec:cat_clust_data}

 We selected four catalogues to cross-match and subsequently identify the most
 distant clusters: \citet[][New Catalog of Optically Visible Open Clusters and
 Candidates, hereinafter OC]{Dias_2002},~\citet[][WEBDA,\footnote{
 \url{https://webda.physics.muni.cz/}} hereinafter WB]{Netopil_2012},
 \citet[][Milky Way Star Clusters Catalog, hereinafter MW]{Kharchenko_2012},
 and~\citet[][hereinafter CG]{Cantat_2020}.
 %
 The first two (OC and WB) are compilations of open clusters' fundamental
 parameters from the literature. They contain around 1700 (WB) and 2100 
 (OC) entries, and are heavily used in the field of open cluster research.
 The parameter values in both catalogues are heterogeneous, being compiled from
 various sources.
 The MW catalog is the largest one ($\sim$3000 entries) and, similarly to the CG
 catalog ($\sim$2000 entries), is composed of homogeneous fundamental parameter
 values obtained for all its entries. The method employed by the authors of the
 MW catalog is a semi-automated isochrone fit, while the CG catalog was
 generated employing an artificial neural network (trained on parameter values
 taken from the literature).

 Since we are interested in the open clusters most distant from the Sun, we
 select from these cross-matched catalogues those that are located at a
 distance of 9000 pc or more in either of them. This is an arbitrary value that
 results in enough clusters to draw general conclusions, but not too many that
 would impede their detailed analysis.\\

 The initial full list consisted of thirty-eight open clusters. Eleven of these
 were found only in the MW catalog with distances larger than 9000 pc. These are
 either listed with substantially smaller distances in the other catalogs, or
 too sparse and or dubious. Hence these clusters were removed from the
 cross-matched list.
 %
 Two other clusters were also removed: Shorlin 1 ($\alpha_{2000}$=166.44,
 $\delta_{2000}$=-61.23) and FSR0338
 ($\alpha_{2000}$=327.93, $\delta_{2000}$=55.33). The latter appears in WB and
 MW at a distance of 12600 pc and 5600 pc respectively, while the former is
 listed only in MW with a distance of 14655 pc. Shorlin1 is studied
 in~\cite{Carraro_2009} and~\cite{Turner_2012}; in both cases the authors
 conclude that this is not a real cluster but a grouping of young stars.
 % Shorlin 1
 %
 % Carraro & Costa (2009)
 % > We also present evidence that this extremely distant group, formerly assumed
 % to be a star cluster (Shorlin 1), is a diffuse, young population, typically
 % found in spiral galaxies.
 %
 % Turner (2012)
 % > ...star counts also imply that Shorlin 1 is unlikely to represent a true
 % cluster, but is instead merely the trapezium-like remains of a previously-
 % bound cluster with an implied age of only a few Myr, according to the likely
 % presence of O-type stars within its boundaries.
 %
 FSR0338 is analyzed in~\cite{Froebrich_2010} where a distance of 6000 pc is
 assigned, but with large uncertainties.
 % Froebrich et al. (2010)
 % > Th high probability members of this newly identified cluster seem to indicate
 % an object with an age of 0.4 Gyrs at a distance of 6 kpc. The scatter in the
 % data points suggests larger than normal uncertainties for the parameters.
 %
 In both cases we find no evidence of a true stellar cluster in these regions.
 We base our conclusion on two findings. First, the large proper motions
 dispersion of the stars that occupy the overdensity around the central
 coordinates assigned to either object. Second, the lack of a clear sequence in
 their respective color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). These two clusters are thus
 discarded from further analysis. The remaining twenty-five clusters that will
 be studied in this work are shown in Table~\ref{tab:clusters}. Most of the
 selected clusters are located in the Third Quadrant with all of them in the
 latitude range of [-12$^{\circ}$, 8$^{\circ}$], relatively close to the
 galactic plane. The final list thus contains 24 clusters in the MW catalog,
 21 in WB, 19 in OC, and 16 in CG.

 There are two other major works where a large catalog of analyzed open clusters
 is presented: \cite{Lui_2019} and \cite{Dias_2021}. The latter does not contain
 clusters with such large distances, and was hence not used. The former lists
 only four clusters that are also present in our set of twenty-five selected
 clusters. None of their distances comply with our selection filter, hence this
 database was not included. This fact notwithstanding, their distance values will
 be mentioned in the discussion of the results in Sect.~\ref{sec:results}.\\

 Data from Gaia EDR3~\citep{Gaia_2016,Gaia_EDR3} was retrieved for a box of 20
 arcmin of length around the central coordinates for all the clusters. We
 employed equatorial coordinates, parallax, proper motions, and photometry
 ($G$, $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$) from these survey.
 %
 In Fig~\ref{fig:MWmap} we show the twenty-five selected clusters for each of
 the four catalogues, positioned on the face-on view of the Galaxy (top), and
 two edge on views (center, bottom). The spiral arms are those presented
 in~\cite{Momany_2006}. The large dispersion for the distances
 assigned to each cluster in different catalogs is clearly visible, where
 ideally the position of all the clusters would overlap for the four catalogs.\\

 In what follows we will only show the figures for a single representative
 cluster (Berkeley 29) to avoid the clutter and improve the readability of the
 article. The plots for the remaining clusters can be found in the appendix.

\section{Cluster analysis}
 \label{sec:clust_analy}

 \subsection{Structural analysis}
  \label{sec:clust_analy}

  The first step in the cluster analysis is the estimation of their structural
  properties, i.e. center coordinates and limiting radius. Although centers and
  diameters are present in (some of) the catalogues, not all of these values are
  correct. We use our \texttt{ASteCA} package
  \citep{Perren_2015}\footnote{\url{http://asteca.github.io/}} throughout this
  work to perform the structural and fundamental parameters analysis. We have
  applied this tool to the study of hundreds of clusters in previous articles,
  with excellent results~\citep{Perren_2017,Perren_2020}.

  The center values are obtained applying a two-dimensional kernel density
  analysis (KDE) on each of the cluster's coordinates. This method assigns the
  center of the cluster to the point with the largest density in the frame. As
  shown in previous articles \citep{Perren_2015,Perren_2017,Perren_2020}, this
  approach is robust even when applied on frames with star densities that
  are very much non-uniform. See for example the case of van den Bergh-Hagen 37,
  shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:12struct}.

  A King's profile~\citep{King_1962} fit is performed on the radial
  density profile of each cluster to estimate their core and tidal radii
  ($r_{c}$, $r_{t}$). The adopted radius $r_{a}$ is the limiting distance from
  the center used to define the studied cluster region for each cluster. These
  radii are estimated applying a process that compares the ratio of the
  approximated number of true members for increasing radii values, with the
  number of stars in a concentric ring centered on each radius. The
  approximated number of members is obtained as the total number of stars within
  the radius, minus the expected number (field density times circle area). This
  method produces an overdensity around the value where the radial density
  approaches the field density, maximizing the contrast between members included
  within the radius and contaminating field stars. The method is also useful
  for heavily contaminated cluster, and/or clusters with very few true
  members. All radii values are shown in Table~\ref{tab:radii}.\\

  The adopted radius $r_{a}$ is on average 50\% smaller than the
  tidal radius (see Table~\ref{tab:radii}). This allows us to alleviate the
  issue of field star contamination, while ensuring that only a small number of
  true members (cluster stars located as far from the center as the tidal
  radius) are lost.
  The fraction of lost members can be estimated integrating King's profile. This
  fraction depends on the concentration of the cluster ($r_{t}/r_{c}$) and the
  value of the adopted radius as a fraction of the tidal radius ($r_{a}/r_{t}$).
  In our case, less than 20\% of the members could be lost in a worst case
  scenario. Since these are clusters that are strongly contaminated 
  (particularly in the parallax and proper motions spaces), the trade off
  between losing a small portion of members and improving the contrast of the
  true members over the field noise, is positive.

  The $r_{a}$ values used in our analysis being smaller than the tidal radius,
  means that the total estimated mass for each cluster shown in
  Sect.~\ref{sec:results}, must be thought of as a lower limit.\\

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:BER29_struct} we show the structural analysis, center and
  radii estimation processes, for the cluster Berkeley 29. The asterisks in the
  equatorial coordinates of the left plot indicate that these were shifted
  and transformed so that the center of the frame is located at (0, 0) and to
  remove projection artifacts. The right plot shows the radial density analysis
  where the dashed green line and the shaded green area are the King profile fit
  and its 16th-84th uncertainty region, respectively. The green dotted vertical
  line, solid red vertical line, and solid green vertical line, are the core 
  ($r_{c}$), adopted ($r_{a}$), and tidal ($r_{t}$) radii, respectively. The
  dashed and dotted horizontal black lines are the field density estimate and
  its $\pm1\sigma$ region, respectively.

\section{Discussion and results}
 \label{sec:results}

\textbf{Saurer 3}:
The color magnitude diagram (CMD hereinafter) of this cluster suggests a ''turn-off'' point (TO from now on) at about G=19. Members appear scattered around the main sequence, probably because of increasing of Gaia photometry errors with distance. The evident cluster ''red-clump'', RC hereinafter, is set at G= 16.5. The analysis gives a distance 6.7 kpc and the age is 4.8 Gyr. \cite{2003MNRAS.346...18C} utilize CCD VI photometry finding a distance of 9.6 kpc, over 50\% above our estimate. The age they assigned, 1.8 Gyr, too much different from ours as well. Maybe these differences in age and distance come from wrong membership assignations when using photometric arguments in a zone of confusion between cluster and background stars. 

\textbf{Saurer 6}:
The CMD denotes a wide and short main sequence where the TO appears at few more than G=18. The giant branch is quite scattered though the RC is evident. The RDP gives a cluster radius of $2^{\prime}$ showing high star density what may explain the main sequence widening. Also duplicity of stars is a quite reasonable assumption. Saurer 6 is 1.6 Gyr old and its distance is 8.74 kpc. This object also was studied by \cite{2002AJ....123.2552F} using CCD VI photometry. For them, Saurer 6 is about 2 Gyr old and is placed at 9.3 kpc, both values are not far from ours and neither is the color excess E they found.

\textbf{Berkeley 102}:
 The CMD is composed of a scattered main sequence with the TO at G=18.5 and a defined giant branch next. Some stars above the TO could be binary stars or unresolved pairs. This cluster is placed at 7.6 kpc and is 4.9 Gyr old. Both age and distance are strongly discrepant with \cite{Cantat_2020} values since they give a distance of 10.5 kpc and an age near 3.9 Gyr. The nature of the analysis done by \cite{Cantat_2020} makes difficult explain the different results despite data are the same. There is a small color excess discrepancy between our analysis and that of CG that cannot reduce the gap between results. Certainly, when looking at the CMD, one is led to think that the TO could be set at G=18 instead of G=18.5, but this would end up in an even shorter distance and therefore larger discrepancy with CG.  

\textbf{Berkeley 25}:
The CMD shows several stars above the TO that are candidates to blue straggler stars. The cluster giant branch is well evident. The RDP of Berkeley 25 shows that this cluster has a radius about $5^{\prime}$; the distance we found is 7.2 kpc and the color excess is 0.35. The cluster age is 5.6 Gyr. These values are quite different from the estimated ones by \cite{2005A&A...442..917C} who found that Berkeley 25 is 3.0 Gyr old, its color excess is E=0.17 and the distance is d=11.3 kp (four kpc over our estimate). It is to be added that the radius Of Berkeley 25 given by these authors is $0.8^{\prime}$, just a 20\% of the found here. No doubt, part of the disagreement arise from a better estimation of the cluster parameters with Gaia data.  Berkeley 25 was included in the Dias et al catalog with a distance of 11.4 kpc and an age of 5.0 Gyr.

\textbf{Berkeley 26}:
It is not so relevant projected against the background field. Although the cluster RDP is well established and the radius is near $2^{\prime}$, the TO is confuse due to the scatter of the stars and the likely presence blue straggler candidates. The giant branch is less notorious so that the best synthetic cluster fitting at the position of the TO results in a  E= 0.45, is located at d= 4.8 kp and is 7.7 Gys old. \cite{2010MNRAS.402.2720P} investigated this object previously finding  E=0.75, age= 4 Gyr and d=4.3 kpc. The differences in excess and distance can be justifiable in terms of the small number of stars and difficulties when estimating photometric membership alone. Also the age difference is huge; we understand that this difference may be due to the fact that we set the cluster TO at G=18.5, almost half a magnitude below the used by Piatti et al. This cluster has been included in the Dias et al catalog with a distance of 12.5 kpc -that is why we included it in our study-, probably a mistake.


\textbf{Berkeley 76}:
The CMD of Berkeley 76 shows a diffuse TO at G=16.5 followed by a relevant giant branch. The parameters indicate a distance of 5.3 kpc, an age of 1.9 Gyr and a color excess of 0.58. There is a strong disagreement with the distance given by \cite{2013MNRAS.428..502C} since their TO is at V=18.5, almost 2 mag below ours and the distance they found is 12.6 kpc with about $2.5^{\prime}$ radius (the RDP provides a radius over $4^{\prime}$) and 1.5 Gyr old. Only the a E=0.55 and the cluster age are similar to our values. We believe that the distance difference with Carraro et al. comes from a wrong TO adopted by Carraro et al., due to the difficulties in determining cluster membership using just photometric arguments. Our results, on the other hand, are not very different from the ones obtained by \cite{Cantat_2020}. 


\textbf{CZ 30}: 
The CMD is composed by a robust cluster main sequence and a clear giant branch. The best simultaneous fitting of both structures happens for a TO situated at G = 17.5 approx. Analyzing the members inside the cluster radius from the RDP it turns out that the distance is d=6.5 kpc and the age is 3.5 Gyr. There is a good agreement then with the distance obtained by \cite{Cantat_2020} but strong differences with \cite{2015AJ....150..200H}. In fact they performed CCD BVI finding a distance of d= 9.12 kpc and an age 2.8 Gyr. The distance has been then largely overestimated in their analysis. A quick reading to their Table 7 shows that all the previous studies yielded larger distances than the derived in the present study.

\textbf{VDBH 4}:
This cluster is not very relevant in the visible band. The CMD shows a quite curious main sequence extending for almost 4 magnitudes but stars above G= 18.5 mag appear shifted toward the blue border of the sequence while above G= 18.5 most of them are well placed along it. The cluster distance is 8.1 kpc and its age is 1.2 Gyr. \cite{2007A&A...464..573C} performed VI CCD photometry in this object finding an age of 0.2 Gy and d= 19.3 kpc. Both distance and age are the most controversial points with these authors since the data analysis leaves no chance that our distance can change for over 10 kpc to get close to their value, and neither the age. 

\textbf{Tombaugh 2}: 
This cluster is probably the most populated in the sample. Looking at the CMD a very wide main sequence followed by a populous giant branch with a relevant RC are evident. The large number of stars above the TO point suggests the presence of candidates to blue stragglers. The RDP confirms a cluster radius near 3$^{\prime}$. Tombaugh 2 is 1.9 Gyr old and is placed at a distance of 8.8 kpc. These values are close to the ones of \cite{Cantat_2020}, 1.6 Gyr and 9.3 kpc, for age and distance, respectively. The present distance do not agree with the 7.2 kpc obtained by \cite{2010A&A...509A.102V}  from photometric arguments alone. With the same strategy of analysis \cite{2008MNRAS.391...39F} proposed an abundance spread amongst the members of Tombaugh 2 (or overlapping between poor and metal rich stars); they adopted a distance of 7.9 kpc and an age of 2.0 Gyr, all values taken from previous photometric observations (see their article). Due to the presence of variable stars the cluster was also observed by \cite{1992AcA....42..155K} estimating an age of 4 Gyr and a distance of 6.3 kpc.

\textbf{Berkeley 73}:
It shows a well-defined main sequence inside a $2^{\prime}$ radius from the RDP. The cluster exhibits a clear TO though the giant branch is a bit redder than expected. There are a few stars above the TO that could be candidates to blue straggler. We obtained then d= 5.2 kpc and an age near 4.5 Gyr. \cite{Cantat_2020}, using the same database, obtained an age of 1.4 Gyr and a distance of 6.1 kpc. Also in line with our findings are the results from \cite{2005A&A...439.1135O}, 2.3 Gyr and 6.5 kpc for age and distance, respectively. CCD UBVI photometry has been carried out by \cite{2005A&A...442..917C}; they found that the age and distances are 1.5 Gyr and 9.7 kpc respectively. 

\textbf{Kronenber 31}:
This obscured and compact cluster is included in a radius of less than $2^{\prime}$ as seen in the RDP. It has been possible to get membership despite . The main sequence is short and the TO is identified at G= 18.3. The data scatter around the giant branch can be partially explained by the presence of binary stars. But it happens that this cluster suffers a large color excess E=1.24 too, a fact that can justify, partially, the scatter seen in the giant branch. As for our analysis, Kronenber 31 is 0.95 Gyr old and it is placed at a distance of 8.1 kpc. This object has been also studied in JHK bands by \cite{2006A&A...447..921K} who found $1.3{\prime}$ radius, a color excess E=0.84 (0.6 less than ours) and a distance of 11.9 Kpc, not confirmed by our analysis.

 \subsection{Metallicity gradient}
  \label{ssec:met_gradient}

  The radial metallicity ([Fe/H]) distribution, or metallicity gradient, is a
  key tracer of the Galaxy's chemical evolution. Open clusters have been used as
  a tool to investigate this relation for several decades~\citep{Janes_1979}.
  Although we have a somewhat small sample, we present here the results to
  highlight the 

  \cite{Donor_2020}, 

  Six of the clusters in our sample were investigated in~\cite{Netopil_2021} in
  relation with the metallicity gradient: BER25, BER29, BER73, CZER30, SAU1,
  and TOMB2.
