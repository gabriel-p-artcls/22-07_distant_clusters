I made changes to the affiliations.

The editor called pyUPMASK 'the Unsupervised Photometric Membership Assignment in Stellar Clusters'. This is not the name of our package (pyUPMASK). The name pyUPMASK is a derivation of another package (UPMASK). Because pyUPMASK is a Python implementation of UPMASK (hence the 'py'), it is not an acronym.
