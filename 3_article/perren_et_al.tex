\section{Introduction}

 The unprecedented amount of high precision data for parallaxes, proper motions,
 and photometry provided by the Gaia mission in successive
 deliveries~\citep[DR2 and EDR3,][]{Gaia_2016,Gaia_EDR3} offers us a unique
 opportunity to estimate the fundamental parameters, age, distance, the observed
 mass and the metal content of open clusters (OC).
 Indeed, the arrival of new techniques for
 analyzing massive data combined with the increasing data precision promise
 more reliable results than those obtained with the old techniques mostly
 based on the visual inspection of their color-magnitude diagrams and
 isochrone fittings \citep{Phelps1994} or on direct comparison with HR diagrams
 of synthetic clusters \citep{Siess1997}. Automated processes such as the one
 applied by \cite{Kharchenko_2012} have also played an important role in
 determining cluster parameters in a massive way. But the continuous increase
 of high quality data is a defying circumstance where a variety of analysis are
 being considered even including artificial neural networks
 \citep{Cantat_2020} combined with new strategies for determining cluster
 memberships \citep{Krone2014,Cantat2018} or fractal analysis as the one applied
 by \citep{Gregorio_2015}.

 %
 The intrinsic value of studying OCs has been profusely described in several
 opportunities and we are not going to repeat them here. However a brief
 enumeration of the importance of these object is appropriate: the oldest OCs
 allow us to investigate the extension in height and radial extension of the
 galactic disk; old OCs tell us about the chemical history, the mixing processes
 and the processes of OCs destruction by interaction with other populations of
 the galaxy as well as the age-metallicity relationship 
 \citep{Friel1995,Tosi_2004,Hayes_2015}. The youngest OCs, on the other hand, are
 not only used as laboratories to investigate stellar evolution~\citep[they allow
 studying in detail the boundary conditions necessary to create new generations
 of stars, ][]{Lada2003} but are also routinely employed too in the analysis
 of the Milky Way's
 structure~\citep{Loktin_1992,Moitinho_2006,Vazquez2008,Moitinho_2010}
 becoming particularly useful in the tracing of spiral
 arms~\citep{carraro_2013,Molina_2018}.
 %
 Young OCs are mainly arranged along the galactic disk where the strong visual
 absorption and the contamination by field stars very often prevent observing
 stars in the lower part of the sequence of these objects.
 In this sense, the situation is not much better for the older OCs which do not
 have very luminous stars in the main sequence, although they do in the giant
 branch. Stars in the lower part of their sequences, as well as those belonging
 to the giant branch, share similar photometric characteristics with field stars
 making it quite difficult to unravel to which population each star
 belongs~\citep{Hayes_2015}.
 %
 The situation worsens as the distance to the older OCs increases because the
 limiting magnitude increases, which results in only a small portion of
 the lower part being visible. But it is not only the photometric
 space that is disturbed by distance. The proper motions of distant OCs are
 extremely difficult to separate clearly from those characterizing the field
 population against which we see them projected, therefore introducing an
 additional degree of confusion in determining memberships.

 Our interest in this current article is twofold. On the one hand, it is focused
 on reexamining the distances and properties of the most distant OCs cataloged
 so far in our Galaxy. A total of 25 such distant clusters were found
 inspecting four different recognized databases that satisfy this requirement as
 we will explain below. However, these bases show enormous differences in the
 parameters determined for them, both in distances and in ages. In part, the
 differences in the parameters for the same object may be
 due to the different techniques used to obtain them combined with the problem
 of the very large distance at which they are located.
 %
 It is of great interest that the ages for most of these OCs included in recent
 catalogs, estimated with advanced analysis techniques, are presumed to be
 larger than one billion years. But in other catalogs these same clusters have
 relatively small ages and shorter distances as well. We want to
 contribute with our analysis to resolve the origin of these differences.
 %
 On the other hand, we want to test our new membership estimation technique
 pyUPMASK\footnote{\url{https://github.com/msolpera/pyUPMASK}}~\citep{Pera_2021}
 in combination with
 \texttt{ASteCA}\footnote{\url{http://asteca.github.io/}}~\citep{Perren_2015},
 on clusters with proper motions that are
 not easily distinguishable from that of surrounding stars, made up by a small
 number of members, and with non-trivial sequences in the photometric space.\\


 This article is structured as follows. In Sect~\ref{sec:cat_clust_data} we
 introduce the stellar cluster catalogues, the clusters selected to be
 analyzed (crossed-matched from those catalogues), and the photometric and
 astrometric data used to perform the analysis.
 Sect~\ref{sec:clust_analy} presents the methods employed in the study of all the
 clusters. The comparison of the estimated parameters with the catalogued
 values for each cluster is done in Sect~\ref{sec:results}. Finally,
 conclusions are highlighted in Sect~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Catalogues, clusters, and data}
 \label{sec:cat_clust_data}

 We selected four catalogues to cross-match and subsequently identify the most
 distant clusters: \citet[][New Catalog of Optically Visible Open Clusters and
 Candidates, hereinafter OC02]{Dias_2002},~\citet[][WEBDA,\footnote{
 \url{https://webda.physics.muni.cz/}}]{Netopil_2012},
 \citet[][Milky Way Star Clusters Catalog, hereinafter MWSC]{Kharchenko_2012},
 and~\citet[][hereinafter CG20]{Cantat_2020}.
 %
 The first two (OC02 and WEBDA) are compilations of open clusters' fundamental
 parameters from the literature. They contain around 1700 (WEBDA) and 2100 
 (OC02) entries, and are heavily used in the field of open cluster research.
 The parameter values in both catalogues are heterogeneous, being compiled from
 various sources.
 The WEBDA catalog is the largest one ($\sim$3000 entries) and, similarly to the CG20
 catalog ($\sim$2000 entries), is composed of homogeneous fundamental parameter
 values obtained for all its entries. The method employed by the authors of the
 MWSC catalog is a semi-automated isochrone fit, while the CG20 catalog was
 generated employing an artificial neural network (trained on parameter values
 taken from the literature).

 Since we are interested in the open clusters most distant from the Sun, we
 select from these cross-matched catalogues those that are located at a
 distance of 9000 pc or more in either of them. This is an arbitrary value that
 results in enough clusters to draw general conclusions, but not too many that
 would impede their detailed analysis. The final twenty-five clusters that were
 studied in this work are shown in Table~\ref{tab:clusters}.\\

 \begin{table*}

 ordered by right ascension. The ages are expressed as the logarithm, and the
 distances are in parsec. In parenthesis, the short names used for the clusters

 the 9000 pc limit in any of the catalogs are marked with boldface.}

 Our full list initially consisted of thirty-eight open clusters. Eleven of
 these were found only in the MWSC catalog with distances larger than 9000 pc.
 These are either listed with substantially smaller distances in the other
 catalogs, or too sparse and or dubious. Hence these clusters were removed from
 the cross-matched list.
 %
 Two other clusters were also removed: Shorlin 1 ($\alpha_{2000}$=166.44,
 $\delta_{2000}$=-61.23) and FSR0338
 ($\alpha_{2000}$=327.93, $\delta_{2000}$=55.33). The latter appears in WEBDA and
 MWSC at a distance of 12600 pc and 5600 pc respectively, while the former is
 listed only in MWSC with a distance of 14655 pc. Shorlin1 is studied
 in~\cite{Carraro_2009} and~\cite{Turner_2012}; in both cases the authors
 conclude that this is not a real cluster but a grouping of young stars.

 % cluster, but is instead merely the trapezium-like remains of a previously-
 % bound cluster with an implied age of only a few Myr, according to the likely
 % presence of O-type stars within its boundaries.
 %
 FSR0338 is analyzed in~\cite{Froebrich_2010} where a distance of 6000 pc is
 assigned, but with large uncertainties.
 % Froebrich et al. (2010)
 % > Th high probability members of this newly identified cluster seem to indicate
 % an object with an age of 0.4 Gyrs at a distance of 6 kpc. The scatter in the
 % data points suggests larger than normal uncertainties for the parameters.
 %
 In both cases we find no evidence of a true stellar cluster in these regions.
 We base our conclusion on two findings. First, the large proper motions
 dispersion of the stars that occupy the overdensity around the central
 coordinates assigned to either object. Second, the lack of a clear sequence in
 their respective color-magnitude diagrams (CMD hereinafter). These two clusters
 are thus also discarded from further analysis.\\

 Most of the twenty-five selected clusters are located in the Third Quadrant
 with all of them in the latitude range of $\left[-12^{\circ}, 8^{\circ}\right]$,
 relatively close to the galactic plane. The final list thus contains 24
 clusters in the MWSC catalog, 21 in WEBDA, 19 in OC, and 16 in CG20.

 There are two other major works where a large catalog of analyzed open clusters
 is presented: \cite{Lui_2019} and \cite{Dias_2021}. The latter does not contain
 clusters with such large distances, and was hence not used. The former lists
 only four clusters that are also present in our set of twenty-five selected
 clusters. None of their distances comply with our selection filter, hence this
 database was not included. This fact notwithstanding, their distance values will
 be mentioned in the discussion of the results in Sect.~\ref{sec:results}.\\

 Data from Gaia EDR3~\citep{Gaia_2016,Gaia_EDR3} was retrieved for a box of 20
 arcmin of length around the central coordinates for all the clusters. We
 employed equatorial coordinates, parallax, proper motions, and photometry
 ($G$, $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$) from these survey.
 %
 In Fig~\ref{fig:MWmap} we show the twenty-five selected clusters for each of
 the four catalogues, positioned on the face-on view of the Galaxy (top), and
 two edge on views (center, bottom). The spiral arms are those presented
 in~\cite{Momany_2006}. The large dispersion for the distances
 assigned to each cluster in different catalogs is clearly visible, where
 ideally the position of all the clusters would overlap for the four catalogs.\\

 In what follows we will only show the figures for a single representative
 cluster (Berkeley 29) to avoid the clutter and improve the readability of the
 article. The plots for the remaining clusters can be found in the Appendix.

\section{Cluster analysis}
 \label{sec:clust_analy}

 \subsection{Structural analysis}

  The first step in the cluster analysis is the estimation of their structural
  properties, i.e. center coordinates and limiting radius. Although centers and
  diameters are present in (some of) the catalogues, not all of these values are
  correct. We use our \texttt{ASteCA} package
  \citep{Perren_2015}\footnote{\url{http://asteca.github.io/}} throughout this
  work to perform the structural and fundamental parameters analysis. We have
  applied this tool to the study of hundreds of clusters in previous articles,
  with excellent results~\citep{Perren_2017,Perren_2020}.

  The center values are obtained applying a two-dimensional kernel density
  analysis (KDE) on each of the cluster's coordinates. This method assigns the
  center of the cluster to the point with the largest density in the frame. As
  shown in previous articles \citep{Perren_2015,Perren_2017,Perren_2020}, this
  approach is robust even when applied on frames with star densities that
  are very much non-uniform. See for example the case of van den Bergh-Hagen 37,
  shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:12struct}.

  A King's profile~\citep{King_1962} fit is performed on the radial
  density profile of each cluster to estimate their core and tidal radii
  ($r_{c}$, $r_{t}$). The adopted radius $r_{a}$ is the limiting distance from
  the center used to define the studied cluster region for each cluster. These
  radii are estimated applying a process that compares the ratio of the
  approximated number of true members for increasing radii values, with the
  number of stars in a concentric ring centered on each radius. The
  approximated number of members is obtained as the total number of stars within
  the radius, minus the expected number (field density times circle area). This
  method produces an overdensity around the value where the radial density
  approaches the field density, maximizing the contrast between members included
  within the radius and contaminating field stars. The method is also useful
  for heavily contaminated cluster, and/or clusters with very few true
  members. All radii values are shown in Table~\ref{tab:radii}.\\

  The adopted radius $r_{a}$ is on average 50\% smaller than the
  tidal radius (see Table~\ref{tab:radii}). This allows us to alleviate the
  issue of field star contamination, while ensuring that only a small number of
  true members (cluster stars located as far from the center as the tidal
  radius) are lost.
  The fraction of lost members can be estimated integrating King's profile. This
  fraction depends on the concentration of the cluster ($r_{t}/r_{c}$) and the
  value of the adopted radius as a fraction of the tidal radius ($r_{a}/r_{t}$).
  In our case, less than 20\% of the members could be lost in a worst case
  scenario. Since these are clusters that are strongly contaminated 
  (particularly in the parallax and proper motions spaces), the trade off
  between losing a small portion of members and improving the contrast of the
  true members over the field noise, is positive.

  The $r_{a}$ values used in our analysis being smaller than the tidal radius,
  means that the total estimated mass for each cluster shown in
  Sect.~\ref{sec:results} must be thought of as a lower limit.\\

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:BER29_struct} we show the structural analysis, center and
  radii estimation processes, for the cluster Berkeley 29. The asterisks in the
  equatorial coordinates of the left plot indicate that these were shifted
  and transformed so that the center of the frame is located at (0, 0) and to
  remove projection artifacts. The right plot shows the radial density analysis
  where the dashed green line and the shaded green area are the King profile fit
  and its 16th-84th uncertainty region, respectively. The green dotted vertical
  line, solid red vertical line, and solid green vertical line, are the core 
  ($r_{c}$), adopted ($r_{a}$), and tidal ($r_{t}$) radii, respectively. The
  dashed and dotted horizontal black lines are the field density estimate and
  its $\pm1\sigma$ region, respectively. The plots for the remaining cluster can
  be seen in Appendix~\ref{app:struct_analysis}.

    systems, respectively.}
   \label{fig:BER29_fpars}
  \end{figure*}

  Before we can estimate the fundamental parameters with \texttt{ASteCA}, we
  need to select the set of most probable members for each cluster. For this
  task we employed our recently developed pyUPMASK algorithm which demonstrated
  a great performance even for very contaminated clusters, outperforming
  UPMASK~\citep{Krone2014} as demonstrated in~\cite{Pera_2021}.

  pyUPMASk requires an input data set composed of $(\alpha, \delta)$ coordinates
  and at least two dimensions of data of any type to estimate the membership
  probabilities. We chose to make use of the proper motion data dimensions only,
  thus excluding photometric and parallax data.
  We made the decision of leaving out these extra data dimensions because,
  although they can be sometimes useful in the process of singling out the most
  probable members, for these type of very distant clusters they tend to add
  more noise than information.
  This is particularly true for the parallax data which
  rapidly tends to zero for stars beyond $\sim$2 kpc, where the parallax values
  for the cluster members become almost indistinguishable from the contaminating
  field stars. The selected clustering method in pyPMASK was a Gaussian Mixture
  Model, which demonstrated to have the best performance in~\cite{Pera_2021} 
  (see Sect. 4).

  Once pyUPMASK has assigned membership probabilities to all the stars in the
  frame, we must select the set of stars that most likely belong to the
  cluster (i.e., the true members). This step is usually handled by selecting
  an arbitrary cut-off probability value; in~\cite{Cantat_2020} for example
  the authors fix this value to P=70\%. Instead of setting an ad-hoc value, we
  performed an analysis that combines the membership probabilities with the
  stellar density inside and outside of the cluster region. This allows us to
  estimate the number of cluster members expected within the cluster region.
  Combining this number with the membership probabilities given by pyUPMASK we
  select those stars with the largest probabilities within the cluster region,
  such that the resulting total number of members is as close as possible as the
  expected one (i.e., the one obtained through the stellar density analysis).
  Using a physically reasonable number of members not only reduces the
  probability of excluding true members (by only selecting those with the
  largest membership probabilities), it also ensures that the estimation of the
  total mass parameter is properly performed by \texttt{ASteCA}.\\

  After selecting the set of true members for all the clusters as described
  above, we apply our \texttt{ASteCA} package to estimate the fundamental
  parameters: metallicity, age, total mass, fraction of binary systems,
  distance, and extinction. The code uses the ptemcee parallel tempering
  Bayesian inference algorithm~\citep{ptemcee} to sample the fundamental
  parameters' distributions. The likelihood function employed to asses the fit
  between the observed cluster and the synthetic clusters is the Bayesian
  Poisson ratio defined in~\cite{Tremmel_2013}.
  The theoretical isochrones used to generate the
  synthetic clusters used to match the observed clusters are the PARSEC
  tracks~\citep{Bressan_2012}. Priors are uniform for all the parameters using
  the following limiting ranges:

  \begin{itemize}
   \item metallicity (z): [0.001, 0.03]
   \item logarithmic age: [8, 10.1]
   \item total mass: [1e2, 2e5] $M_{\odot}$
   \item binarity fraction: [0, 1]
   \item distance modulus: [10, 20] mag
   \item $E_{BV}$ extinction: [0, $E_{BV}^{max}$]
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent The maximum value for the extinction priors, $E_{BV}^{max}$, was set
  on a per-cluster basis selecting the values given by the~\cite{Schlegel_1998}
  extinction maps with the re-calibration by~\cite{Schlafly_2011}.
  
  In Fig.~\ref{fig:BER29_fpars} we show the result of the membership
  probabilities estimation done with pyUPMASK, plus the fundamental parameters
  estimation performed by \texttt{ASteCA}. We only show here the plots for
  the cluster Berkeley 29, the remaining clusters can be seen in
  Appendix~\ref{app:fundam_params}.
  The plot on the left shows the vector point diagram (VPD) with the proper
  motion distributions for both the selected clusters members, and the field
  stars. The members are clearly very much embedded within the field stars
  distribution, which is expected for distant clusters. The center plot shows
  the CMD traced by the selected members, and the right plot a sampling of the
  best fit synthetic cluster obtained. The isochrone is associated with the
  synthetic cluster but it is there merely to guide the eye, the fit is
  performed for the CMD of the observed cluster versus the CMD of synthetic
  clusters, not versus theoretical isochrones~\citep[this is further
  explained in:][]{Perren_2015,Perren_2017,Perren_2020}.\\

\section{Results and discussion}
 \label{sec:results}

 This section is divided as follows.
 In Sect.~\ref{ssec:databases} we show the general results for the
 fundamental parameters. These are contrasted with values taken from the
 aforementioned databases, with particular emphasis on the distances.
 %
 Following that, in Sect.~\ref{ssec:indiv_clusters} we discuss each cluster
 individually. We comment on the most relevant studies published in the
 literature and how these compare to the results obtained in this article.
 %
 Finally, in Sect.~\ref{ssec:met_gradient} we analyze our results in the context
 of the radial metallicity gradient and the age vs metallicity relation.\\

 Henceforth we employ the default values for the Galactocentric coordinate
 frame given by the astropy
 package\footnote{\url{https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/galactocentric.html}}:

 \begin{itemize}
  \item ICRS coordinates of the Galactic center: (266.4051$^{\circ}$,\\
  -28.936175$^{\circ}$)
  \item Distance from the sun to the Galactic center: 8.122 pc
  \item Distance from the sun to the Galactic midplane: 20.8 pc
  \item Velocity of the sun in the Galactocentric frame as Cartesian velocity
  components: (12.9, 245.6, 7.78) km/s
 \end{itemize}

  Table~\ref{tab:results} shows the fundamental parameters along with their
  uncertainties estimated by \texttt{ASteCA}, where the [Fe/H] parameter was
  obtained using the approximation given in the CMD service for
  [M/H].\footnote{Assuming [M/H]$\sim$[Fe/H], [Fe/H]$=\log(Z/X)-\log(Z/X)_{o}$, where:
  $(Z/X)_{o}=0.0207; Y=0.2485+1.78Z$.\\

  The Bayesian inference process was allowed to run for enough steps to achieve
  convergence.
  As shown in the table all the analyzed clusters are rather old, with the
  youngest one (vd Bergh-Hagen 37) assigned an age of $\sim0.8$ Gyr; although
  notice the very large uncertainty associated to it. It is worth noting
  that only about half of the clusters are truly beyond the 9 kpc ($\sim$14.8
  mag) limit originally used to perform the selection from the published
  databases. The binary fraction ranges from 30\% up to $\sim90$\% for the
  cluster Saurer 3. The total estimated masses are found in the range [2000,
  60000] M$_{\odot}$ with the exception of vd Bergh-Hagen 176, for which a mass
  of 170000 M$_{\odot}$ is given. It is worth noticing however that this is a
  lower limit estimate since \texttt{ASteCA} does not take into account the
  experienced dynamical mass loss, which can be significant for old stellar
  clusters~\citep{Martinez_2017}.\\

  In a recent study~\citep{Anders_2021} per-star parameters such as distance,
  extinction, metallicity, and age were estimated. Comparing the results
  from this analysis with those from \cite{Cantat_2020}, the authors find
  differences in the distance values larger than 3 kpc for clusters located at
  6 kpc or more from the Sun. We find even larger discrepancies between our
  analysis and those taken from the four databases. As shown in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:distances}, all but the CG20 database show differences of up
  to 10 kpc for clusters spanning the full distance range. Even the CG20
  database, the one with the better overall match to our values, shows
  differences larger than 2 kpc for clusters located at a distance of $\sim10$
  kpc from the Sun. It is thus clear that even the database with the closest fit
  contains substantial disagreements with the distance values estimated by 
  \texttt{ASteCA}. We see no evident trend that correlates the differences in
  the distance with the ages (used to color the circles in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:distances}).\\


  \begin{figure*}
   \resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics[]{figs/dist.png}}
   \caption{\texttt{ASteCA} versus database distances. The plots to the right
   stacked vertically are the \texttt{ASteCA} distances versus the differences
   in the sense (\texttt{ASteCA} - database). Clusters are colored according to
   the $\log\,age$ assigned by \texttt{ASteCA}.}
   \label{fig:distances}
  \end{figure*}

  We can analyze the difference between our age estimation and those from
  the four databases; the results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ages}. The top plot
  shows that \texttt{ASteCA} systematically assigns ages that are larger on
  average than those from the databases, and more so as the estimated age
  increases. A difference of 3 Gyr for an age of 8 Gyr (the average difference
  shown in the plot) translates to a logarithmic difference of $\sim$ 0.2 dex,
  which is a reasonable uncertainty given the complexities associated to the
  clusters under investigation.
  The largest difference arises with Kronberger 39, for which \texttt{ASteCA}
  finds an age of $\log(age)=9.5$ but has an age of $\log(age)=6$ assigned in
  the MWSC database (the smallest age by far in the four databases).

  As can be seen in the bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:ages}, there appears to be
  a correlation between the difference in age estimates and the binarity
  fraction estimated. The trend shows that the larger the percentage of binary
  systems present in the cluster, the larger on average is the difference
  between the age value obtained by \texttt{ASteCA} and those in the
  databases. Such an effect can be explained by noticing that the TO in the CMD
  is pushed downwards by the presence of binaries, which are located above the
  brightest point of the main sequence of single stars. This in turn forces the
  fit to adjust towards larger ages, hence producing the systematic trend
  seen in the analysis. This result points to the importance of taking binary
  systems into account when performing stellar clusters' parameters estimations.

  \end{figure}


  To further investigate the various ways to estimate the distance, we performed
  two more analyses. First, we re-run \texttt{ASteCA} for all the
  clusters using four different combinations of settings for the metallicity and
  binary fraction parameters. We chose these two parameters because in
  isochrone-fit analyses they are usually either fixed (e.g., the metallicity is
  set to solar) or neglected altogether (e.g., the binary fraction).
  %
  Second, we compared the distances estimated in this work with those obtained
  via parallax analysis using three different methods: \texttt{ASteCA}'s own
  Bayesian inference estimation~\citep[described in][]{Perren_2020}, the
  distance inferred by the Kalkayotl package~\citep{Kalkayotl}, and the median
  of a simple inversion of the parallax values of the selected members.
  Parallax values were previously corrected using the method described
  in~\cite{Lindegren_2021}\footnote{ Analytical functions to compute the
  expected parallax zero-point as a function of ecliptic latitude, magnitude and
  colour for any Gaia (e)DR3
  source: \url{https://gitlab.com/icc-ub/public/gaiadr3_zeropoint}}.\\

  The results of the two extra analysis mentioned above can be seen in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:dist_comparisions} compared to the main \texttt{ASteCA} run,
  i.e., the one whose estimated parameter values are shown in
  Table~\ref{tab:results}.
  In the top plot we show the variation in the distance estimates between our
  main \texttt{ASteCA} run and four different runs: metallicity fixed to solar
  and binary fraction fixed to 0 ($Z=Z_{\odot},b_{fr}=0.0$; blue circles),
  metallicity fixed to solar and binary fraction as a free parameter
  ($Z=Z_{\odot}$; green stars), metallicity as a free parameter and binary
  fraction fixed to 0 ($b_{fr}=0.0$; orange triangles), and metallicity fixed to
  solar and binary fraction fixed to 0.3 ($Z=Z_{\odot},b_{fr}=0.3$; red
  inverted triangles), where 0.3 is usually chosen to be a reasonable estimate
  for open clusters~\citep{Sollima_2010}. The median difference with the main
  \texttt{ASteCA} run is largest when the binary fraction is fixed to 0. 
  ($\sim$1200 pc), lower when we fix this parameter to 0.3 ($\sim$500 pc),
  and lowest when it is allowed to vary ($\sim$25 pc). This is another indicator
  that a proper binary fraction fit is of utmost importance for a correct
  estimation of the cluster's fundamental parameters, particularly for the
  distance. Even when the binary fraction is free, fixing just the metallicity
  to solar values can have a large impact on the estimated distances as shown in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:dist_comparisions} (green stars).
  % $Z=Z_{\odot},b_{fr}=0.0$: 1157
  % $Z=Z_{\odot}$: -25
  % $b_{fr}=0.0$: 1182
  % $Z=Z_{\odot},b_{fr}=0.3$: 518


  The bottom plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:dist_comparisions} shows the parallax values
  analysis. Here the distance estimates obtained by \texttt{ASteCA} processing
  the Gaia eDR3 photometry are compared to three methods to estimate distances
  using parallaxes: \texttt{ASteCA}'s own Bayesian inference, the Kalkayotl
  package estimate, and the inversion of the median of the selected member's
  parallaxes. It is clear to see that a trend arises where the most distant
  clusters have their distances enormously underestimated by any of the
  parallax-based methods. This is expected, as the parallax values of the most
  distant clusters are associated to very large uncertainties and are also
  heavily affected by noise from non-removed field stars that mostly contaminate
  the lower mass region.
  It is surprising to see that the naive approach of inverting the median of
  the member's parallaxes is the method that more closely approximates the
  photometric distances estimated by \texttt{ASteCA}: the mean difference is
  only $\sim$ 600 pc, where the other two methods show median differences more
  that twice as large ($\sim$ 1300 pc).

 \subsection{Cluster by cluster discussion}
  \label{ssec:indiv_clusters}

  In this section we discuss each cluster separately, in the context of how our
  findings compare to those published in the literature.\\

  \noindent \textbf{Berkeley 73}: Its CMD shows a main sequence and a well
  defined turn-off (TO from now on) point, followed by a giant branch that is a
  bit redder than expected. Probably some stars above the TO could be candidates
  to blue stragglers. There is no strong evidence of stars forming a red clump 
  (RC hereinafter).
  The results from~\cite{Ortolani_2005}, \cite{Carraro_2005},
  and~\cite{Carraro_2007_oldOC} for this cluster are 2.3/1.5/1.5 Gyr and
  6.5/9.7/11.5 kpc for the age and distance, respectively.
  \texttt{ASteCA} gives values for distance and age of 4.9 kpc and 5.75 Gyr,
  closer and older than the values found in any of the four databases and the
  above mentioned articles. This is thus a rather old cluster, located well
  below the 9 Kpc limit.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 25}: The CMD shows a clear giant branch and several stars
  above the TO that can be candidates to blue straggler stars. The RDP of
  Berkeley 25 shows a radius about $5^{\prime}$, the largest one in the sample.
  The distance assigned by \texttt{ASteCA} is 7.2 kpc with an age of 6.0 Gyr,
  meaning that the cluster is located at a closer distance and is found to be
  older than what is shown in the databases.
  % These values are also rather different from the ones estimated
  % by~\cite{Carraro_2005}, who found an age of 3.0 Gyr and a distance of 11.3
  % kpc. The authors assumed a cluster radius of $0.8^{\prime}$, which is only
  % 20\% of the one we found.
  In~\cite{Carraro_2005} the authors assumed a cluster radius of $0.8^{\prime}$,
  only 20\% of the one we employed, and estimated an age of 3.0 Gyr and a
  distance of 11.3 kpc. These values are similar to the ones given
  in~\cite{Carraro_2007_oldOC} of 5 Gyr and 13.2 kpc for the age and the
  distance.
  Along with a better parameter estimation performed by \texttt{ASteCA} using
  Gaia data, the rather small cluster region used may explain the differences
  between our parameters and those by Carraro et al.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 75}: This is a sparse cluster, with less than 100 detected
  members. \cite{Carraro_2005} claim that this cluster possess
  a TO at $V= 17.5$ mag, a radius of $1^{\prime}$, an age of 3.5 Gyr and is
  located at a distance of 9.8 kpc.
  Our analysis yielded a $2^{\prime}$ radius with the TO set at $G=17.7$ mag.
  The giant branch is poorly populated though it shows a two-star RC.
  There are some stars above the sub-giant branch that could be explained
  by binary systems. Our analysis concludes that Berkeley 75 is 6.0 Gyr old
  cluster, placed at 7.9 kpc. This distance is similar to the one found by CG20
  of 8.3 Kpc, although the age assigned by CG20 is substantially smaller (1.7
  Gyr). The age assigned by OC02 is closer to ours (4 Gyr) but their distance is
  larger by $\sim$1 kpc.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 26}: This cluster appears as a not so relevant overdensity
  projected against the background field. Although its RDP is well established
  and the radius is near $2^{\prime}$, the cluster TO is diffuse due to the
  scatter of stars and the likely presence blue straggler candidates. The
  giant branch is even less notorious.
  The position adopted for the TO is $G=18.5$ mag resulting in a distance of 4.8
  kpc and an age of 8.1 Gyr. \cite{Piatti_2010} claim that Berkeley 26 is 4 Gyr
  old and is placed at 4.3 kpc. While their distance value is close to ours, the
  age difference is important. This is related to the fact that \texttt{ASteCA}
  sets the cluster almost half a magnitude below the TO used by Piatti et al.,
  due to the presence of a large number of binary systems (which our code
  estimated to be around 70\%).
  WEBDA and MWSC locate the cluster at 4.3 kpc and 2.7 kpc, respectively, the
  latter assigning to it a very young age of $\sim$0.5 Gyr. The OC02 database
  includes this cluster with a distance of 12.5 kpc. This is apparently
  a mistake, since the original source for this value is \cite{Piatti_2010}.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 29}: \cite{Tosi_2004} carried out a photometric analysis
  and found that this could be the most distant cluster in our galaxy to date.
  The parameters they attribute to this object are an age of 3.5 Gyr and a
  distance ranging from 11.2 to 14.4 kpc.
  Similar to our study, they compared the observed CMD of Berkeley 29 against a
  synthetic cluster set. The corresponding CMD produced by our method
  shows a visible TO between $18<G<19$ mag followed by a sub-giant and giant
  branches with a RC at $G=16.5$ mag or slightly less. We found that the
  distance to Berkeley 29 is 14.2 kpc and the age is $\sim$4 Gyr, in good
  coincidence with Tosi et al. The CG20 catalog indicates an age of 3 Gyr and a
  distance of 12.6 kpc, smaller that our estimate, while the 4 Gyr and 13.4
  kpc, for the age and distance reported by \cite{Frinchaboy_2006} are also
  rather close. As we will see this turns out to be the second most
  distant catalogued cluster so far, below vd Bergh-Hagen 176, if we measure
  the distance to the Sun. If we measure instead the galactocentric distance,
  then Berkeley 29 is indeed the most distant catalogued cluster as found
  by~\cite{Tosi_2004}, located at almost 22 kpc from the galactic center (see
  Table~\ref{tab:velocities}).\\

  \textbf{Tombaugh 2}: This is a populous cluster with almost 900 identified
  members. Looking at its CMD a very wide main sequence followed by a giant
  branch with a relevant RC are evident. We speculate that part of the stars
  above the TO point may be blue stragglers. Tombaugh 2 is 1.9 Gyr old and is
  placed at a distance of 8.9 kpc according to \texttt{ASteCA}. These values are
  close to the ones registered by CG20 which are 1.6 Gyr and 9.3 kpc for the age
  and distance, respectively. The distances reported by OC02 and MWSC are below
  $\sim$7 kpc, and the value found in WEBDA is above $\sim$ 13 kpc.
  \cite{Villanova_2010} claim that this cluster is at 7.2 kpc.
  Using a strategy of analysis supported by photometric arguments alone, 
  \cite{Frinchaboy_2008} proposed an abundance spread among the members of
  Tombaugh 2 (overlapping between poor and metal rich stars). They adopted a
  distance of 7.9 kpc and an age of 2.0 Gyr.
  % all values derived from previous photometric observations (see their article).
  Due to the presence of variable stars the cluster was also observed by
  \cite{Kubiak_1992}, estimating an age of 4 Gyr and a distance of 6.3 kpc.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 76}: The CMD of Berkeley 76 shows a diffuse TO at $G=16.5$
  mag, followed by a relevant giant branch. The parameters indicate a distance
  of 5.5 kpc, and an age of 1.8 Gyr, far from the 12.6 kpc distance given
  by \cite{Carraro_2013_Five} although the age they determined, 1.5 Gyr, is
  close to ours. This same distance is reported by OC02 and WEBDA, while a
  smaller and much more reasonable value of 4.7 kpc is given in CG20.
  The distance discrepancy can obey to the fact that Carraro et al. set
  the TO at $V=18.5$ mag, 2 magnitudes below ours.\\

  \textbf{FSR 1212}: This is a sparse cluster with less than 100 identified 
  members whose overdensity visibly stands out in the coordinates space. The CMD
  shows a defined cluster TO at $G=17.5$ mag with a giant branch and a RC that
  are also well established. We notice a slight reddening of stars along the
  giant branch that can be explained by the presence of binary systems 
  ($\sim$50\% for the cluster).
  Our analysis indicates an age around 1.2 Gyr and a distance of 10.1
  kpc. Both parameters are in good agreement with the CG20 database, which
  assigns an age of 1.4 Gyr and a distance of 9.6 kpc. MSWC on the other hand
  locates this cluster at 1.8 kpc with an age of 0.4 Gyr, which is entirely too
  close and too young.\\

  \textbf{Saurer 1}: This cluster was analyzed by \cite{Carraro_2003} under
  the name of Saurer A, who estimated an age near 5 Gyr and a distance of 13.8
  kpc for a TO placed at $V=19$ mag. According to these authors, Saurer 1 is the
  cluster with the largest galactocentric distance detected. In this work we
  found that this title actually belongs to Berkeley 29, which is $\sim2$
  kpc further out than Saurer 1 (see Table~\ref{tab:velocities}).
  Our CMD shows the position of the TO at $G=19$ mag, a visible red giant
  branch and a handful of stars assumed as RC stars. From our analysis we find
  that the age of Saurer 1 is 6.4 Gyr and its distance is 12.4 kpc. The
  disagreement with~\cite{Carraro_2003} is thus minimum regarding the
  cluster distance given the associated errors. A smaller age, 4.5 Gyr, and
  a barely larger distance, 13.1 kpc, were determined
  by~\cite{Frinchaboy_2006}.\\

  \textbf{Czernik 30}: The CMD for this cluster shows a robust main sequence
  and a defined giant branch. The TO is situated at $G=17.5$ mag approximately.
  Our analysis results in a distance of 6.6 kpc and an age of 3.5 Gyr. The
  distance is in good agreement with that of CG20 but strongly differs with
  the one found in~\cite{Hayes_2015}. Hayes et al. determined 9.12 kpc and 2.8
  Gyr for the distance and age, respectively, meaning that they have
  overestimated the cluster distance. Looking at their Table 7 we see that
  seven previous studies yielded distances in the range [7.9, 9.3] kpc, all
  larger than the new one derived by\texttt{ASteCA} in this work.
  This includes our own previous analysis of the
  cluster in~\cite{Perren_2015}, where we assigned a slightly larger distance of
  8 kpc.\footnote{Notice that the distance modulus value of 16.07 mag quoted in
  Table 7 of Hayes et al. is incorrect. The proper value is $\sim14.5$ mag, as
  shown in Table 7 of~\cite{Perren_2015}.}\\

  \textbf{Arp-Madore 2}: also know as ESO 368-7, this cluster's CMD shows
  a well traced TO and red giant branch with a very short main sequence, and a
  well established RC at $G=17$ mag.
  % Looking at Fig. 7 of~\cite{Ortolani_1995} the TO is located
  % 17<V<18 and the TO at V=20 while ours is G=19.5.
  % The CMD we have produced shows a sort of blueshift suggesting the cluster is
  % less metallic than the sun as also stated Ortolani et al.
  %
  According to~\cite{Ortolani_1995} this cluster is located at a distance of
  12.4 kpc with an intermediate age (no specific value is given), and a metal
  content of [Fe/H]$\sim-0.3$.
  The UBVI CCD photometry analysis carried out in~\cite{Lee_1997} resulted in
  estimates of 8.87$\pm$0.65 kpc and $5\pm1$ Gyr for the distance and the age,
  and of [Fe/H]$=-0.51\pm0.12$ for the metallicity.
  CG20 estimated a distance of 11.7 kpc and an age of 3.0 Gyr.
  %
  \texttt{ASteCA} found $\sim$11 kpc and 3.9 Gyr for the distance and
  age, respectively, with a metal content of [Fe/H]=-0.24 which matches the
  sub-solar values reported by Ortolani et al. and Lee.
  Our distance thus is a good match for that of CG20, falling within the range
  given by the two previous studies mentioned.\\

  \textbf{vd Bergh-Hagen 4}: With only 70 confirmed members, this is the
  second less populated cluster. A very weak but extended main sequence is
  visible in the CMD stretching almost 4 magnitudes.
  % where stars above $G=18.5$ mag appear blue-shifted with respect to the main
  % sequence and those below this value placed along it.
  The cluster distance and age are estimated to be $\sim$9.9 kpc and 0.8 Gyr,
  both with large associated uncertainties.
  \cite{Carraro_2007} performed VI CCD photometry on this object finding an
  age of 0.2 Gy and a distance of 19.3 kpc. Although the distance given by
  \texttt{ASteCA} after processing the Gaia data is not accurate (the 16th-84th
  range spans almost 5 kpc), the value given by Carraro et al. lies outside
  of the 2-sigma range making it highly unlikely. The age parameter on the other
  hand is much closer to our estimate.
  % Both distance and age are the most controversial points with these authors
  % since the Gaia data analysis leaves no chance that our distance can change for
  % over 10 kpc, and neither the age.
  Looking at Fig. 17 of Carraro et al. we can see that their CMD for this
  cluster is considerably more contaminated than ours, with a large number of
  obvious field stars polluting the diagram.\\

  \textbf{FSR 1419}: CG20 found that FSR 1419 is 1.6 Gyr old and is placed at a
  distance of 11.1 kpc. We see in the respective CMD that the TO is set at G= 18
  approximately. The TO is clearly immersed in a scattered region at the top of
  the cluster main sequence where some stars may be binaries while other are
  blue straggler candidates. Evidences of a RC are found by the star grouping at
  over approximately G= 16.5. The age found in the present analysis is close to 4
  Gyr and the distance is 9.3 kpc. There is a large difference in distance
  with CG20 value. \\  

  \textbf{vd Bergh-Hagen 37}: This cluster has been catalogued by \cite{Dias_2002}
  as an object placed a 11.22 kpc with an age about 0.7 Gyr. \cite{Piatti_2010},
  on the contrary, claim this object is at 2.5 kpc with an age ranging from 0.7 to
  1 Gyr. There is then a remarkable distance difference between both results. When
  looking at our CMD we see a main sequence extending for over 4 magnitudes, no red
  giant branch nor evident RC stars. Our analysis gives 2.7 kpc distance and 
  an age of about 0.8 Gyr, more in line with Piatti et al. results. Taking into account
  that the~\cite{Dias_2002} data for this cluster comes from Piatti et al.,
  there must have been a mistake when storing the value into the databse, probably a
  typo error. Large differences appear comparing our results with that from CG20, who
  affirm that BH37 is located at a distance of 4.0 kpc and its age is 0.17 Gyr. These
  results also differ substantially with the ones from Piatti et al. \\

  \textbf{ESO 092 05}: \cite{Ortolani_2008} have estimated an
  age of 6 Gyr for a distance of 11 kpc for this object.  Our distance is
  larger, 13.0 kpc, but the age is almost the same, 5.5 Gyr.  The TO from Ortolani et
  al is set near V=19 while ours is set  at few more than G= 18.5.On the other
  hand CG20 analysis yielded a distance of 12.4 and the age is 6
  Gyr. So, regarding the cluster distance the agreement is quite good.\\ 

  \textbf{ESO 092 18}: According to photometric analysis made by \cite{Carraro1995},
  this cluster is at 8.1 kpc and is 5 Gyr old (by the
  way, there is mistake in their coordinates). We could estimate its parameter from a
  robust 2 mag long main sequence where the TO is at G=18.5, the red giant branch
  and the RC are well remarked. Some stars at 15 <G<17.5 are candidates to blue
  stragglers. It is probable that this cluster has a large number of binaries to
  explain the large number of star above the TO. Our analysis gives 5.5 Gyr and
  the distance is 11.1 Kpc.  CG20 gave 2.8 Gyr and 9.9 kpc. The VI observations by
  \cite{Phelps_1994_develop} obtained 0.6 kpc and about 1 Gyr age.\\

  \textbf{Saurer 3}: The CMD of this cluster
  suggests a TO point at about G=19. Members appear
  scattered around the main sequence, probably because of increasing 
  photometric errors of Gaia data with distance. The evident cluster ''red-clump'', RCci
  hereinafter, is set at G= 16.5. The analysis gives a distance 6.6 kpc and the
  age is 4.4 Gyr. \cite{Carraro_2003} utilize CCD VI photometry finding a
  distance of 9.6 kpc, over 50\% above our estimate. The age they assigned, 1.8
  Gyr, too much different from ours as well. Maybe these differences in age and
  distance come from wrong membership assignations when using photometric
  arguments in a zone of confusion between cluster and background stars.\\

  \textbf{Kronberger 39}: This open cluster looks affected by moderate
  absorption. Therefore, it was studied in the JHK bands by \cite{Kronberger_2006}
  and catalogued as a \emph{cluster candidates with RC}. These authors computed a
  distance of about 11.1 kpc but with no estimate about its
  age. It is worth mentioning that they estimated a 0.8 arcmins
  radius while ours is 2 arcmins. We identified the cluster TO near G = 20 and the
  RC at G= 17.5-18 and obtained a distance of 12.8 kpc and an age 2.9 Gyr.\\

  \textbf{ESO 093 08}: \cite{Bica_1999} claim this cluster is placed at 13.5 kpc with an age
  4-5 Gyr using VI photometry. Given the limiting magnitude of the G
  observations in the GEDR3 we could only be able to determine the red giant
  branch. It is interesting that when seen at the CMD (their Fig 3) shown by
  Bica et al.  the cluster RC is notorious and placed at 18 < V < 19. Ours is found
  along the giant branch at almost G=18. Therefore, we found a distance of
  13.2 kpc, similar to Bica et al's, and 8.5 Gyr age. \\

  \textbf{vd Bergh-Hagen 144}: This cluster is also referred to as
  Andrew-Lindsay 1 and ESO 96-SC04, known for hosting the planetary nebula PHR
  1315-6555~\citep{Parker_2011}.
  \cite{Carraro_2005_neglected} gave a distance of 16.9 kpc and an age of
  0.8 Gyr. Looking at their Fig. 9, lower panel is easy to see the complex task
  that determining cluster members is and to establish the TO position within a
  region of $0.6^{\prime}$ radius as they assumed.  Our analysis suggests from the
  RDP that the cluster radius is over 1.5 arcmins and densely populated. The
  CMD of this cluster shows a densely populated main sequence ending up in a TO
  situated at G= 17.5. The giant branch is scattered but suggests a RC at the
  same G.  The presence of a large number of binaries cloud be the reason of
  such a data scatter. Our analysis gives a distance of 9.5 kpc, quite different
  from the values from Carraro et al 2005, and an age around 1 Gyr.
  On the other hand, CG20 found a distance of 9.6 kpc and an age close to 1.4
  Gyr while \cite{Majaess_2014} reported a distance of 10.0$\pm$0.4 kpc and an
  age of 0.8$\pm$3 Gyr. Both age and distance values for these two articles are
  very close to ours.\\

  \textbf{vd Bergh-Hagen 176}: According to \cite{Ortolani_1995} this cluster
  could be in the border line between globular and galactic clusters. Like
  they, we were unable to establish the position of the TO, since it is not visible
  in the CMD. Despite this the cluster red giant is so clearly defined that we
  could estimate a distance of 19.8 kpc and a cluster age of 5.1 Gyr. With this huge 
  distance from the Sun vdBH turns out to be the most remote open cluster ever found.
  \cite{Ortolani_1995} have given a distance of 13.4 kpc and just mention
  that vdBH 176 could be as old as NGC 6791 or, to be proven, a rich/metal
  globular cluster. The age of 5.1 Gyr we derived in this work is close
  to the determination made by \cite{Frinchaboy_2006} of 6.3 Gyr however,
  the distance they gave of 15.8 kpc is quite far from ours.\\

  \textbf{Kronberger 31}: This obscured and compact cluster has a radius
  of less than $2^{\prime}$. Anyway, it was possible to identify a short
  main sequence, the TO at G=18.3 and the giant branch. The data scatter
  around the giant branch can be partially explained by the presence of
  binary stars, duplicity and errors. But since this cluster suffers large
  color excess, E(B-V)=1.24, too, that can justify, partially, the scatter
  seen in the giant branch. As for our analysis, Kronberger 31 is 0.97 Gyr
  old and it is placed at a distance of 8.2 kpc. \cite{Kronberger_2006}
  studied this object in the JHK bands cataloguing it as a \emph{cluster
  candidate with RC}, and finding a $1.3^{\prime}$ radius, a color
  excess E=0.84 (0.6 less than ours) and a distance of 11.9 Kpc, not
  confirmed in the current analysis.\\

  \textbf{Saurer 6}: The CMD denotes a wide and short main sequence where the TO
  appears at few more than G=18. The giant branch is quite scattered though the
  RC is evident. The RDP gives a cluster radius of $2^{\prime}$ showing high
  star density what may explain the main sequence widening. Also duplicity of
  stars is a quite reasonable assumption. Saurer 6 is 1.4 Gyr old and its
  distance is 9.3 kpc. This object also was studied by
  \cite{Frinchaboy_2002} using CCD VI photometry. For them, Saurer 6 is about 2
  Gyr old and is placed at 9.3 kpc, both values are not far from ours and
  neither is the color excess E they found.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 56}: CG20 gave about 3 Gyr and 9.5 kpc for age and distance. The CMD
  shows a defined sequence, a clear TO at G=16.5 and a red giant branch and RC
  at 15.5 also defined properly (our giant branch is a bit reddish).  Our
  findings are that the cluster is 5.6 Gyr and is placed at a distance of 11.0
  kpc.\\

  \textbf{Berkeley 102}: The CMD shows a scattered main sequence with the
  TO at G=18.5 and a defined giant branch next. Some stars above the TO could be
  binary stars or unresolved pairs. This cluster is placed at 7.6 kpc and is 4.9
  Gyr old. Both age and distance disagree with \cite{Cantat_2020}
  values as they gave a distance of 10.5 kpc and an age near
  3.9 Gyr. The nature of the analysis done by CG20 makes difficult
  explain the different results despite data are the same. There is a small
  color excess discrepancy between our analysis and that of CG20 that cannot
  reduce the gap between results. Certainly, when looking at the CMD, one is led
  to think that we could set the TO at G=18 instead of G=18.5, but this would
  end up in an even shorter distance and therefore larger discrepancy with CG20.
  Both CG20 and the present analysis confirm that Berkely 102 is a true open cluster
  in opposition to \cite{Maciejewski_2008} who concluded it is dubious cluster after their
  analysis.\\

  The radial metallicity distribution ([Fe/H] vs $R_{GC}$), or metallicity
  gradient, is a key tracer of the Galaxy's chemical evolution. Open clusters
  have been used as a tool to investigate this relation for several
  decades~\citep{Janes_1979}.
  Although we have a somewhat small sample, we present here the results to
  highlight the difficulties that arise when estimating the metal content from
  photometric data alone.
  The gradient is usually taken to be around -0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for the inner
  clusters, with a break beyond $R_{GC}\approx10$ kpc into a shallower
  slope~\citep{Donor_2020}. In~\cite{Donor_2018} it was previously shown that
  the metallicity gradient is also (expectedly) highly dependent on the database
  used fix the distances, varying as much as 40\% depending on the used
  database. This result was confirmed in~\citep{Donor_2020}, where a
  database-dependent variation of of 15\% was found.
  % from Donor et al (2020)
  % Donor et al. (2018) (henceforth OCCAMII) showed that this gradient could
  % change by as much as 40%, depending on which distance catalog was used
  %

  We found six clusters from our sample that were also investigated in recent
  works: Berkeley 25, Berkeley 29, Berkeley 73, Czernik 30, Saurer 1, and
  Tombaugh 2; studied in \cite{Donor_2020}, \cite{Netopil_2021}, and
  \cite{Spina_2021}. The [Fe/H] values are shown in Table~\ref{tab:metal} along
  with the \texttt{ASteCA} estimates. The uncertainties are around 0.02, 0.06,
  and 0.04 dex for Donor et al., Netopil et al., and Spina et al., respectively.
  The uncertainties associated to the \texttt{ASteCA} values are substantially
  larger, almost averaging 0.3 dex (see Table~\ref{tab:results}). Note however,
  that for most of the clusters in Table~\ref{tab:metal} the metal content was
  estimated using three stars or less, which is a rather small number from which
  to derive proper statistical errors. What we see in this table is what can
  also be seen in~Fig.\ref{fig:met_gradient}: \texttt{ASteCA} assigns on average
  larger metallicities that those expected.
  There is a visible concentration
  of nine clusters around $R_{GC}\sim13$ kpc grouped around
  [Fe/H]$\approx0.1$ dex, where the Donor et al. linear relation
  predicts a value of [Fe/H]$\approx-0.3$ dex. On the other hand, the clusters
  analyzed in~\cite{Perren_2020} (shown as grey circles in the plot) display a
  much more balanced distribution around the [Fe/H]$\approx0.0$ dex expected
  value for their galactocentric distance of $\sim9$ kpc.
  Given the large uncertainties for the metallicities given by \texttt{ASteCA},
  the clusters at $R_{GC}\sim13$ kpc could still land close to the Donor et al.
  relation within the 2-sigma region.

  There are two clusters where the metal content estimated by \texttt{ASteCA}
  differs beyond the 2-sigma range from the gradient given by Donor et al.:
  vd Bergh-Hagen 144 and Saurer 1, both identified by their names in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:met_gradient}.
  %
  In the case of vd Bergh-Hagen 144 its estimated metallicity of 
  [Fe/H]$=-0.65_{-0.69}^{-0.43}$ is well below the expected solar value at that
  galactocentric distance ($\sim$8 kpc). This fact notwithstanding, there are
  two other articles where a similar markedly sub-solar metallicity was found
  for this cluster: \cite{Frinchaboy_2004} and \cite{Fragkou_2019}. In these
  studies the reported metallicity values are [Fe/H]=-0.51$\pm$0.3 
  (spectroscopic metallicity from 2 stars) and [Fe/H]$\approx$-0.40 (photometric
  estimate)\footnote{Transformed from the fitted Z=0.006 assuming
  $Z_{\odot}=0.0152$}, for Frinchaboy et al. and Fragkou et al. respectively.
  %
  Fragkou et al. assigned a distance of 12$\pm$0.5 kpc, $\sim4$ kpc
  larger than the one found by \texttt{ASteCA}, while
  in~\cite{Frinchaboy_2004b} the estimated distance is 9.35 kpc which is a much
  closer value to ours.

  Saurer 1 (also known as Saurer A) on the other hand was assigned a super-solar
  abundance by \texttt{ASteCA} of [Fe/H]=$0.17_{-0.07}^{0.27}$ which conflicts
  with the value expected for its galactocentric distance of $\sim19.7$ kpc.
  There are several articles where this clusters was assigned a sub-solar [Fe/H]
  value: -0.27~\citep{Carraro_2003}, -0.38$\pm$0.14~\citep{Carraro_2004},
  -0.50~\citep{Frinchaboy_2004b}, -0.38~\citep{Frinchaboy_2006},
  -0.42$\pm$0.01~\citep{Donor_2020}. The distances given to Saurer 1 in these
  studies are located in the range [12, 13.2] kpc, a reasonable match
  for the distance estimated by \texttt{ASteCA} of $12.5_{11.1}^{14.1}$ kpc. It
  would thus seem that \texttt{ASteCA} has overestimated the metal content for
  this cluster. Saurer 1 is the third oldest cluster in our sample ($\sim6.5$
  Gyr) and one of the most distant from the Sun, which results in less than a
  full magnitude visible below the TO with a total of only 90 members present in
  the CMD. This can be the reason for the large metallicity given by 
  \texttt{ASteCA}, although a spectroscopic metallicity study with more
  confirmed members would be ideal to provide a more accurate estimate.\\

  Finally, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_vs_feh} the age-metallicity relation 
  (AMR) for the twenty-five selected clusters in this article, plus the ten
  verified clusters from~\cite{Perren_2020}. The AMR looks very similar to the
  one shown in~\citet[][their Fig. 4]{Salaris_2004} with no visible trends due
  to the lack of very metal poor clusters present in the sample, which would be
  located upwards and to the left of the plot.

\section{Conclusions}
 \label{sec:conclusions}

  The fundamental parameters of the twenty-five most distant catalogued clusters
  ($>9$ kpc) have been reassessed using pyUPMASK and \texttt{ASteCA}. The
  results for the fundamental parameters metallicity, age, distance,
  extinction, total mass, and binary fraction, are shown in 
  Table~\ref{tab:results}. In this table we can see that these are
  rather old clusters: with the exception of just two (vd Bergh-Hagen 37 and
  Kronberger 31), the remaining ones are all older than 1 Gyr.
  Only thirteen clusters out of twenty-five turn out to be at a distance larger
  than 9 kpc from the Sun, thus reducing the number of clusters that fit the
  minimum distance criteria by almost half.

  Regarding the distribution in the galactic plane and the galactocentric
  distance, we see that fourteen clusters are placed in the third galactic
  quadrant with 10 out of these having negative latitudes thus located below the
  formal galactic equator. The remaining four clusters that are above the
  galactic plane are Berkeley 26 ($Z\approx$0.2 kpc), Saurer 1
  ($Z\approx$1.7 kpc), Czernik 30 ($Z\approx$0.5 kpc), and Berkeley
  29 ($Z\approx$2 kpc). The cluster with the largest galactocentric distance,
  Berkeley 29, is also the cluster with the largest vertical distance. This
  cluster is on its course to cross the galactic disk, as shown by its velocity
  vector seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:MWmap_vectors}.
  % Saurer 1 has z near 1.65 kpc and CZER 30 is at z=0.51 kpc. Berkeley 26, one of
  % the oldest cluster in our sample is found at z=0.2 kpc.

  At first glance, it appears that a large number of clusters in the third
  quadrant seem to accompany the warp defined by diffuse blue population
  (\textbf{references are needed}), whose maximum height above the plane takes
  place at about (lat=-8$^{\circ}$, lon=240$^{\circ}$)
  (\textbf{Esto debo completarlo}).
  It is very interesting is to see that five clusters are farther than the
  assumed limit for the galactic disk radius (\textbf{van referencias}). These
  are: Berkeley 29 ($R_{GC}\approx$22 kpc), Tombaugh 2 ($R_{GC}\approx$15
  kpc), FSR 1212 ($R_{GC}\approx$17 kpc), Saurer 1 ($R_{GC}\approx$20 kpc),
  and Arp-Madore 2 ($R_{GC}\approx$16 kpc). These numbers, if confirmed, may
  imply that the galaxy disc may be larger than assumed (\textbf{referencia?}).\\

  When comparing the results given by our analysis with \texttt{ASteCA} with
  those present in the MWSC, WEBDA, OC02 and CG20 databases, we clearly
  see important disagreements in age and distance (the fundamental parameters
  available in the databases).
  % We show in Fig. xx our distances against those
  % given in each database;  just for easing things we indicated the ages of the
  % clusters obtained  by us using a color scale.
  The best overall agreement in distances, the main objective of this article,
  is found with the database presented in CG20. For the sixteen clusters in
  common with this work the differences range from -2 to +3 kpc, without any
  apparent dependency on the ages.
  Within the limits of the uncertainties associated to the distance parameter,
  we can thus say that the agreement with CG20 is reasonably good.
  The differences with other databases are substantially larger, spanning a
  range from -10 to +10 kpc, and are present in the case of MWSC and WEBDA for
  clusters whose catalogued distance is even below 5 kpc.
  The age parameter suffers also from important inconsistencies, this time
  across the databases, which increase as the age estimated by \texttt{ASteCA}
  increases.
  Caution is hence advised when making use of these databases for large scale
  analysis. We thus recommend choosing the CG20 database over the rest whenever
  possible.
