Q1: The ref Frinchaboy et al. 2004b was originally an arxiv article
(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004astro.ph.11127F/abstract). Since the
article was later on published in a conference proceedings
(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006cams.book..130F/abstract), this
reference can be updated to point to the latter:

@INCOLLECTION{Frinchaboy_2006b,
       author = {{Frinchaboy}, P.~M. and {Mu{\~n}oz}, R.~R. and {Majewski}, S.~R. and {Friel}, E.~D. and {Phelps}, R.~L. and {Kunkel}, W.~B.},
        title = "{Star Clusters in the Galactic Anticenter Stellar Structure: New Radial Velocities \& Metallicities}",
    booktitle = {Chemical Abundances and Mixing in Stars in the Milky Way and its Satellites},
         year = 2006,
        pages = {130},
          doi = {10.1007/978-3-540-34136-9\_47},
       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006cams.book..130F},
      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}
}

Notice that I changed the reference ID from 'Frinchaboy_2004' to 'Frinchaboy_2006b'
